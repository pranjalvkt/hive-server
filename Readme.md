1. **API Endpoints Description**: 
   - **User Routes**:
     - `/api/register`: Registers a new user.
     - `/api/login`: Logs in an existing user and returns a JWT.
     - `/api/user`: Returns the user profile, protected by JWT.
   - **Chat Routes**:
     - `/api/chat`: Sends a message to another user, requires JWT authentication.
  
2. **Request and Response Examples**: For each route, Iâ€™ve added example request bodies and expected responses to make it easier for developers to interact with the API.

### Next Steps:
1. Replace `https://github.com/pranjalvkt/hive-server.git` with your actual repository URL.
2. Ensure your API is working according to these routes and adjust accordingly.
